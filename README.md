## Options
- [%] How much crowns merchants have - adjusts available initial funds, maximum funds and  amount of funds added on merchant refresh.
- [Days] How often merchants refresh crowns - pretty self explanatory.
- [%] Merchants goods worth multiplier - merchant item price gets multiplied by this percentage.
- [%] Player goods worth multiplier - player item price gets multiplied by this percentage.

## Installation
1. Download the mod (git pull or download ZIP - doesen't matter)
2. Paste 'modTradeMan' folder to the The Witcher 3 mods folder. (i.e.TheWitcher3\mods). If 'mods' folder does not exist, create it.
3. Copy 'bin' folder that is located inside 'modTradeMan' to the main game directory (see screenshot below if in doubt)

## Additional information
Other modifications may affect the correct operation of TradeMan (one of those is [Fast Stash Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3931)). In some cases [Script Merger](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/484) could solve issues.
